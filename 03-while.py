    # You can make a block of code execute over and over again using a while statement.
    # The code in a "while" clause will be executed as long as the while statementâ€™s condition is True.

    print('This code laughs at your coding skills.')
    print('How big does this laugh have to be?')
    print('Enter the number.')   # introduction
    laughs = int(input())  # select a number

    while laughs > 0:
        print('Ha')
        laughs = laughs - 1
        # inside the loop we print our laugh and decrease the variable by 1
    # the while loop lasts until the variable becomes 0


# the int() around the input() is needed if we want to use the integer inside the string
# if we write a character instead of an integer we get an error
# if we put a negative number we don't get an error because we still met the "while" statement
# a statement like this works fine but doesn't consider the edge cases, like a negative number.

# Standard boilerplate to call the main() function to begin the program.
# copy and paste this stuff everywhere.
